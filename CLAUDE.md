# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Description

This is a satellite precipitation correction project written in Julia, mainly involving:

- GWR / MGWR (Geographically Weighted Regression / Mixed GWR)
- FY4B, GPM, GSMaP satellite precipitation
- Rain gauge observation data

The Julia package itself is named `MixedGWR` (see `Project.toml`) — `using MixedGWR` is the correct import, not the repo directory name.

## Commands

```sh
# Install/resolve dependencies
julia --project=. -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.instantiate()'

# Run the full test suite (test/runtests.jl)
julia --project=. -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.test()'

# Run a single test file directly (most test files are self-contained:
# they `include` the src file they test and can run standalone)
julia --project=. test/test-study-area.jl
julia --project=. test/test-mger-five-kernels.jl
```

`test/test-speed.jl` is a standalone benchmark, not wired into `test/runtests.jl` — run it directly when checking performance.

The first `@testset "GWR"` block in `test/runtests.jl`, plus `test-solver.jl`, `test-ST_GWR.jl` and `test-GWR_mixed.jl`, validate results against the R `GWmodel` package via `RCall` using the `data/prcp_st174_shiyan.csv` fixture. `data/` is gitignored, so that fixture is absent from a fresh checkout and from CI; those four are skipped with a warning when it is missing (`HAS_SHIYAN_DATA` in `test/main_pkgs.jl`) and the other 14 test files still run. Restoring the file re-enables them. Running them needs a working R installation with `GWmodel` installed (`test = ["Test", "Distances", "RCall", "RTableTools"]` in `Project.toml`). Individual test files that don't touch `RCall`/`RTableTools` (e.g. `test-study-area.jl`, `test-era5-*.jl`) can be run without R.

Scripts under `scripts/run_*.jl` and `scripts/verify_*.jl` are the actual entry points for producing results (e.g. `scripts/run_mger_smoke_202206.jl`, `scripts/run_interpolation_benchmark.jl`). They set `LOAD_PATH` to `src/` and are run as plain Julia scripts:

```sh
julia --project=. scripts/run_mger_smoke_202206.jl
```

Run the interpolation benchmark multithreaded, but **not** with `-t auto`. Its dominant loop is
`dynamic_covariate_predict`, which fits one hour per task, and each of those tasks allocates
~1.6 MB — two n×n local-hat matrices among it. Past a handful of threads the large-object
allocation contends worse than the extra cores help, so the loop gets *slower*. Measured on this
24-core box, one full-mode call over 334 tuning hours:

| Julia threads | 4 | 8 | 24 |
|---|---|---|---|
| loop wall time | **167 ms** | 201 ms | 274 ms |

`-t 4` also beat `-t auto` end to end on the smoke benchmark (314 s vs 393 s), with byte-identical
output — the results do not depend on the thread count, only the wall clock does.

```sh
julia -t 4 --project=. scripts/run_interpolation_benchmark.jl full --nested-covariates
```

Four is not a magic number: it is where this machine's allocation contention starts to bite.
Re-derive it on new hardware with `scripts/profile_hour_fit.jl`, which prints the per-hour cost
and the loop's speedup at the thread count it is given. Do not run single-threaded — that is
~3x slower than the best setting.

Do **not** set `BLAS.set_num_threads`. It looks like free speed — the GWR hot path is gemv and
p×p solves, where BLAS threading only contends with the Julia-level threading above — but `tps`
factorizes a dense (n+3)×(n+3) system that is well past OpenBLAS's threading threshold, and a
threaded LU accumulates in a different order. Pinning BLAS to one thread was measured to move
`tps`'s RMSE in the last three or four digits, which propagates into `metrics_pooled.csv`,
`paired_comparisons.csv` and `claim_assessment.csv`. Every other method was byte-identical. The
run's BLAS thread count is therefore part of what makes published numbers reproducible.

The same class of drift showed up again, independent of BLAS, when the full-mode invariance gate
(`scripts/verify_perf_invariance.jl`) was run against the hour-fit perf pass (commit `b822d78`):
`paired_comparisons.csv`'s `ci_high` column moved in its last one or two digits for most rows,
while `ci_low`, `delta_RMSE`, `relative_improvement`, and every other output file (105 of 106)
stayed byte-identical. `_daily_bootstrap_delta`/`paired_bootstrap_rows`
(`src/InterpolationBenchmarkBootstrap.jl`) are themselves single-threaded and fully seeded, so the
difference traces to a sub-ULP perturbation in the `residual_gwr` prediction matrix upstream —
the perf pass's threaded prediction path reordering some sum. It is only visible in
`paired_comparisons.csv` because that file's RMSE is summed per-day (≤526 terms) before
bootstrapping, where a 1-ULP shift is a meaningfully large fraction of the sum; everywhere else
RMSE is pooled over the full ~2.6M-cell dataset, where the same shift is far below print
precision and rounds away. Treat a last-digit-only `ci_high` (never `ci_low`, never the
underlying RMSE/delta columns) as this same benign non-associativity, not a regression.

## Architecture

### Two tiers of `src/`

1. **Core `MixedGWR` module** — algorithms included inside `module MixedGWR ... end` in `src/MixedGWR.jl` (the package entry point): `MGWR.jl`, `metrics.jl`, `kernel.jl`, `gw_weight.jl`, `PrecipitationCorrection.jl`, `solve_chol.jl`, `solve_reg.jl`, `GWR.jl`, `GWR_calib.jl`, `ST_GWR.jl`, `GWR_mixed.jl`, `GWR_mixed_trace.jl`, `deprecated.jl`. These are reached normally via `using MixedGWR` and export the regression/kernel primitives (`GWR`, `MGWR`, `ST_GWR`, `ST_GWR_fast`, `GWR_mixed`, kernel constants `GAUSSIAN`/`EXPONENTIAL`/`BISQUARE`/`TRICUBE`/`BOXCAR`, etc).

2. **Standalone data-pipeline modules** — each of these files defines its *own* `module X ... end` and is loaded through `src/load_modules.jl`, not through the `MixedGWR` module: `StudyArea.jl`, `ERA5LandStations.jl`, `ERA5LandProcessing.jl`, `ERA5LandCovariates.jl`, `ERA5VariableSelection.jl`, `MOD13A2NDVIProcessing.jl`, `NDVIVariableSelection.jl`, `AppEEARSNDVI.jl`, `FY4BPreprocessing.jl`, `TerrainFeatures.jl`, `TraditionalInterpolation.jl`, `DEMTerrainExperiment.jl`, `JointCovariateModels.jl`, `JointVariableSelection.jl`, `MGERDataPrep.jl`, `BenchmarkDiagnostics.jl`. Each handles one data source or processing stage (ERA5-Land, MOD13A2 NDVI, FY4B, terrain/DEM, variable selection, benchmark diagnostics, etc).

3. **`SelectionScaffolding.jl`** — bookkeeping shared by the four variable-selection paths
   (`annotate_selection!`, `append_selection!`, `selection_schemes`). A standalone module like
   those in (2), loaded the same way.

4. `MGERPipeline.jl` and `InterpolationBenchmark.jl` are *not* modules — they are top-level scripts (`using MixedGWR` + struct/function definitions) meant to be `include`d directly by a script or test after `using MixedGWR` is already active. They tie the core GWR algorithms and the data-pipeline modules together into full run/evaluate pipelines (e.g. `MGERConfig`, `run_multikernel_spatial_kfold_pipeline`).

`InterpolationBenchmark.jl` is a thin loader: it pulls in the modules the benchmark needs and then
includes ten concern-specific fragments, in this order — `Config`, `Folds`, `DEM`, `Joint`,
`Predictors`, `Hurdle`, `Tuning`, `Metrics`, `Bootstrap`, `Run`. They are plain top-level
fragments sharing one namespace, not modules, so a name defined in a later file may be called from
an earlier one; include order only has to put shared consts and structs first.
`InterpolationBenchmarkHurdle.jl` holds the deliberately-disabled `hurdle_gwr` model, which is
absent from `BENCHMARK_RUNS` and unreachable in a normal run.

### Loading `src/` from a script or test

There is exactly one idiom. Never `include` a standalone module file directly: `include`ing a file
that defines `module X` a second time compiles a second, type-incompatible copy of it rather than
reusing the first.

```julia
include(joinpath(ROOT, "src", "load_modules.jl"))
load_pipeline("InterpolationBenchmark")            # MGERPipeline / InterpolationBenchmark
load_standalone_modules("BenchmarkDiagnostics")    # any module; dependencies load first
using Main.BenchmarkDiagnostics
```

`load_standalone_modules` loads each module into `Main` at most once, pulling in that module's own
sibling dependencies first; `load_pipeline` does the same for the two top-level fragments, which
are detected by a sentinel struct rather than a module name. `load_modules.jl` itself is safe to
include more than once.

Do **not** add `pushfirst!(LOAD_PATH, joinpath(ROOT, "src"))`. It makes `src/` an implicit
environment and causes `using MixedGWR` to load a second copy of the package, which is a hard
error on Julia 1.11.

Inside a standalone module, reach a sibling with `using Main.X` (add `using Main: X` as well if
the module name itself is used for qualified calls — `using Main.X: a, b` does not bind `X`).

When adding a new file to `src/`, follow the existing pattern: if it's a reusable regression/kernel primitive it belongs inside the `MixedGWR` module (add an `include(...)` line in `src/MixedGWR.jl`); if it's a data-source-specific processing step it should be its own standalone module following convention (2) above.

### Calling convention

`scripts/` calls into `src/` — algorithms and reusable logic live in `src/`, not in scripts. A script typically: sets `LOAD_PATH`, does `using MixedGWR`, `include`s any standalone modules/pipeline files it needs, then builds a config struct and calls a pipeline function.

## Coding Requirements

- Use Julia.
- Avoid irrelevant refactoring.
- Do not change existing function names or parameters unless necessary for the current task.

## Modification Principles

- Only modify code relevant to the current task.
- If you find other problems, point them out first, do not modify them directly.
- Do not delete existing functionality.
- Prioritize simple and easy-to-understand implementation methods.

## Code Style

- Strive for conciseness and clarity; refer to existing code.

## Project Directory and File Conventions

When creating, modifying, or moving files, the following directory structure must be followed. Do not create temporary scripts, data files, images, or output results arbitrarily in the project root directory.

### `assets/` Stores static resources for the project

- Images and illustrations
- Project diagrams

### `data/` Stores research data

```
data/
├── raw/
└── processed/
```

Where:

- `data/raw/`: Raw data, modification is generally prohibited
- `data/processed/`: Data that has been cleaned, transformed, matched, or preprocessed

### `output/` Stores all results generated by the program; writing the results back to `data` is prohibited

### `scripts/` Stores executable task scripts

- `scripts/` is responsible for "calling" the core code
- Core algorithms should not be written directly in the scripts

### `src/` Stores the core Julia source code of the project

For example:

- Distance calculation
- Spatial weights
- Bandwidth selection
- Weighted regression solution
- GWR / MGWR
- Accuracy evaluation tools

Rules:

- Reusable core functions must be placed in `src` first
- Do not write one-off experimental workflows in src/.
- Avoid reading fixed local absolute paths in `src/`
- Core functions should receive data and configuration via parameters whenever possible

## New File Placement Rules

When creating a new file, first determine its purpose

- Program output → `output/`
- Core algorithm → `src/`
- Directly runnable experiments or processing procedures → `scripts/`

`scripts/` handles the process flow, `src/` handles reusable core algorithms
